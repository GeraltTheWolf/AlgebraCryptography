# Algebra Cryptography!

This is repository contains code used in Cryptography course practice labs on Algebra university course.

## Lab 03

In this lab we fix some given python file and make it work.

## Lab 04

In this lab we are manipulating strings and decoding white-space encoded message "this is my string"

## Lab 05

We are creating python script that can take up to three arguments (string and two numbers) and based on them it need to perform:

 - Reverse string
 - Reverse string by 2 letters
 - Reverse string by 3 letters
 - Cesar cipher
 - Cesar Box cipher

## Lab 06

This lab is divided into two parts - first one takes some broken python file and need to make it work and second one needs to implement this fix and use it to generate **One-time pad** encryption and decryption.

## Lab 07

We need to create menu based on given task and to perform hashing of:

 - String
 - File
 - Directory
	 - Recursive
	 - Non recursive
Library that we will be using is [https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html)

## Lab 08

Simple menue and digital signatures for:

 - File
 - Directory
	 - Recursive
	 - Non recursive
	 
Library that we will be using is [https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
